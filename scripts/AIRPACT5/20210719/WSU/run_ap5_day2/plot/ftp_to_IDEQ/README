Sara,
 
A)  Here are the gif files that you have right now:

Today’s runs started yesterday evening and cover today and tomorrow, August 25 and 26th.
Those jobs computed hourly PM2.5 for the days (local days) of 0825 and 0826.
 
Using those two days of hourly PM2.5 results along with the prior day’s hourly PM2.5 results (for 0824) we computed the rolling 24-hr PM2.5 values. (24 values per file)
With three days of PM2.5 values, we can compute 2 days of rolling 24-hr PM2.5 averages.
 
The AMS naming convention is to label averages by the beginning of the period averaged, so these two days of rolling averagePM2.5 are labeled as 082400 through 082600, in PST.
 
For Pacific Standard Time, the relevant timestamps for describing DAY1 and DAY2 (0825 and 0826) 24-hr-avg PM2.5 are: 082500 and 082600.
 
For Mountain Standard Time, the relevant 24-hr-avg PM2.5  timestamps are shifted one hour earlier, and are thus:  082423 and 082523.
 
So your two files providing MST 24-hr-avg PM2.5 imagery for two days of  0825 and 0826 are:
