README of February 25, 2015 by JKV

This directory contains scripts and control data for extraction of AIRPACT-4 results at 
locations of monitoring sites reporting to the AIRNow system.

Extraction stuff was put in place without adequate consideration and foresight on our part 
as to the dynamic nature of the list of monitoring  sites being reported to AIRNow.

For example, ozone monitors are more likely on during spring and summer months and the PM 
monitors are more likely on during the winter and fire seasons.

The script run_site_extract_airpact4.csh uses teh site list found at, or linked from, aqsid.csv.

The aqsid.csv file is read by the executable called by the script and used to create a internal list of 
grid locations as column and row on the grid, and then used for extracting surface layer 
AIRPACT-4 results.

Ideally, any time we would run this script, it would use a list that is correct for the period
being extracted for, the period the runs represent.  
But that was not foreseen as a need and has never gotten desigend in.

So we have instead a spotty history of aqsid-type files used at different times.
