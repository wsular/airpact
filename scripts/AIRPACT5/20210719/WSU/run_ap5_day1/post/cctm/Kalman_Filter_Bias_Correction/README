README for Kalmann Filter Bias Correction for AIRPACT5.

July 30, 2020 JKV

Today, July 30, 2020, the KFBC postprocessing has been integrated and tested as part of the AIRPACT5 postprocessing.

Nicole June (Penn State Univ and now Colorado State Univ) working at the direction of Brian Lamb, Yunha Lee and myself,
developed a Kalman Filter bias estimate code.  Biases were calculated for each PM2.5 monitoring location on the AIRPACT5 grid.
The biases were then interpolated to the AIRPACT5 grid.

KFBC codes:
/home/airpact5/AIRHOME/run_ap5_day1/submit_postcctm.csh builds and qsubs qsub4postcctm.csh
which runs the KFBC python code and the ncl graphics code, producing KFBC resutls that are
interpolated (for now) using three methods.
	1) Linear Kriging
	2) Gaussian Kriging
	3) Cubic Spline.
Then the interpolated bias grid was applied as a correction to the entire grid, to create three bias corrected forecasts.
This was applied only for PM2.5.
We consider the Linear Krigged result to be the preferred, although the Gaussian Krigged is also acceptable.

Files created include those from the KF Bias estimation and the application of interpolated biases to the grid in:
locations such as /data/lar/projects/airpact5/AIRRUN/2020/2020073000/POST/CCTM and files such as
-rw-r--r-- 1 airpact5 lar 868K Jul 30 13:20 PM25_24hr_BiasCorrected_2020073000.ncf
-rw-r--r-- 1 airpact5 lar 8.3K Jul 30 13:19 KFBC_24hr_avg_20200730.csv
-rw-r--r-- 1 airpact5 lar 1.1M Jul 30 13:19 kf_data_20200730.csv
where the netCDF file contains the three gridded variables for Linear, Gausian and Cubic.

Graphics are produced by ncl graphics and are found in gif files, along with txt files for captioning, 
in such dirs as
