README begun 2020-07-30 JKV

Today, July 30, 2020, the KFBC has been integrated and tested as part of the AIRAPCT5 postporcessing.

The codes for generating the json output from daily KFBC results are found in
/home/airpact5/AIRHOME/run_ap5_day1/post/cctm/extract_KFBC_PM2.5
 
KFBC has been integrated and tested as part of the AIRPACT5 postporcessing.
This directory, /home/airpact5/AIRHOME/run_ap5_day1/post/cctm/extract_KFBC_PM2.5
 is for generating a post-processing step to export json encoded ASCII values for the 
KFBC results for DAY1.

Stuff in the extract_KFBC_PM2.5 dir is to write the Linear Kriged KFBC results to a json file for
use in driving a risk calculation app.

The codes for applying KFBC and generating graphics are found in
/home/airpact5/AIRHOME/run_ap5_day1/post/cctm/Kalman_Filter_Bias_Correction
or the soft-linked /home/airpact5/AIRHOME/run_ap5_day1/post/cctm/KFBC
