For extraction of max8hr O3 for Pocatello and Twin Falls sites for 2020 (entire) for IDEQ, Rong Li.
JKV 03/25/21

Starts in dir ~airpact5/AIRHOME/run_ap5_day1/post/cctm/ave08hr_IDEQ
run_08hr_O3_from_saved.csh regenerates the surface level 8-hr rolling average O3 from a given date, 
accessing data from the 'saved' archive.  24 values of rolling 8-hr average O3 are solved per day.
Per run, the input files are the combine files (ncf) from day specified and prior day.
Output file for each run is level 1 rolling 8-hr average O3, also ncf.

Then in dir ~airpact5/AIRHOME/run_ap5_day1/post/cctm/extract_AIRNow_IDEQ (rename!) the codes
run_site_extract_max8hrO3.csh and site_extract_max8hrO3.py extract all the 8-hr o3 values at sites 
listed in AQSID_IDEQ.csv.

A further code is then used to separate the extracted data by site, and per site, calculate the max 8-hr O3 for the day.
