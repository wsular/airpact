# Tested site_extract_V10 python code for col & row locaton from lat, lon.
# Provided these AQSID inputs representing the lat&lon displayed by Google Maps 
# interface of AIRPACT5 web display when cursor is put over the cornermost grid 
# line intersections. 
# AQSID,Latitude,Longitude,long_name

# 000000001   ,40.176800,-125.125700,South West Corner Cell
# 000000002   ,49.718200,-125.884900,North West Corner Cell

# There are 1-285 W to E and 1-258 S to N, gridlines. 
# So each intersection of lines is a crosspoint.
# The col and row values returned are:
#  LAT:  40.1768  LON:  -125.1257  ROW:  0  COL:  0
#  LAT:  49.7182  LON:  -125.8849  ROW:  257  COL:  0
#  LAT:  49.2794  LON:  -109.6169  ROW:  257  COL:  284
#  LAT:  39.8076  LON:  -111.3747  ROW:  0  COL:  284
#  and given that python indexes from 0 by default, these seem to correctly represent the
#  corner locations.
